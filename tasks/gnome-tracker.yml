# Don't run that in Molecule: it succeeds with a Docker without systemd
# but it fails when running in a Docker with systemd.
# Previously we masked it at the global level
# so that it can be run also in a chroot environment
# otherwise we get "Failed to connect to bus: No such file or directory"
# This is required only if run while installing Arch.
# However, when running this in a real Ubuntu, the mask silently fails
# (see https://github.com/LorenzoBettini/my_gnome_role/issues/12)
# at system level; better to mask it at user level.
